## CVE-2014-8517 

FreeBSD tnftp clientside exploit

## soffice api remote

This bug had been found by sud0woodo, he posted a quite exhaustive blog article about it
but seemed not to be allowed or wanting to publish the bug, as there had been ongoing
discussions with soffice's vendor. In the meantime i took the freedom to have a little fun
and building my own exploit, but keeping it offline until sud0woodo publishes all. He did 
already some time ago, now here my version.
